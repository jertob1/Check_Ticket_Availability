I could not miss the Harry Potter movie with live philarmonic orchestra! 
However, the concert was fully booked. I called the concert hall, and they told me that some seats are going on the reselling platform.
The seatsn were going to be sold again very fast, so I needed to make sure that I would be the first one to get my hands on them.
Therefore, I built this very short program scarping information from the html frontend interface to determine whether seats were available. The program would send me an email if the seats became available.
My program worked! I bought seats as soon as I received the email, and had a fantastic time at the concert. 
With this project, I realized that so many functions on my computer, even the most far-fetched ones, could be automated by simple python scripts. I look forward to play more with python to create fun little programs like this one!
